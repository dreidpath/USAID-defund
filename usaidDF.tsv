"PEREZ A PROFESSIONAL CORP"	"THE PURPOSE OF THIS TASK ORDER IS TO ACQUIRE THE SERVICES OF A QUALIFIED ARCHITECT ENGINEERING FIRM HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS THE CONTRACTOR TO PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL DESIGN AND ARCHITECT ENGINEERING SERVICES TO USAID DRC IN SUPPORT OF CRITICAL WATER AND SANITATION INFRASTRUCTURE Absent the Engineering Support Program (ESP), activities focused on providing access to clean water for consumption, cooking, and sanitation operating under the Secretary of State’s humanitarian waiver will fail, and hundreds of thousands of people living in and around Goma in eastern DRC will be at risk for unnecessary disease and death. Without potable, clean water, people will die. Goma’s population of more than 2 million people, has limited access to water (mostly delivered by truck), a situation that is exacerbated by the ongoing conflict and M23 occupation. The Engineering Support Program (ESP) under the A&E Task Order plays a critical role in supporting the U.S. government’s humanitarian and development efforts to deliver water and sanitation infrastructure. The Secretary of State has provided a waiver for lifesaving humanitarian and health interventions in eastern DRC - many of which are focused on supporting the dire water situation in Goma. Without the ESP, water-related interventions will be ineffective and unsustainable, leaving millions of people without this essential, life-saving assistance. These funds provide expert engineering design, rigorous construction supervision, and comprehensive support for water resources, supply, and wastewater infrastructure, particularly in Goma, North Kivu. A key focus of this initiative is to complete the construction of a durable water distribution system and high-performance booster station in Goma, essential for restoring safe, reliable water access to Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps, and communities in and around Goma, recently devastated by armed conflict. By ensuring strict engineering standards and long-term sustainability, this program guarantees lifesaving water supply, subsequently safeguarding displaced and resident communities from disease"	16628372	"10005429"	2024-04-19	2029-04-18	"USAID/DROC (Congo)"	"funded"

This will enable key stakeholders involved in migrants’ assistance to be prepared for repatriations and stand ready to welcome migrants even when informed in a very short notice."	4e+07	"$19,800,000"	2021-09-19	2025-09-30	"USAID/Haiti"	"defunded"

Soybean produced by African countries is 1% of the total world production and the domestic need for food and feed is met by importing over four million metric tons (MT) of soybean grain and its products. Soybean grain yield (around 1 MT/ha) is 39% lower than world average and 68% lower than that of the USA. Constraints that contribute to such low yields are a) biotic and abiotic stresses, b) narrow germplasm adapted to tropical environments, c) limited access to quality seeds for farmers including financing, d) inadequate agronomic practices, e) absence of small-scale farm mechanization, and f) inadequate market linkages. Key results or outcomes expected are: a) soy breeding programs of National Agriculture Research Systems (NARS) and CGIAR in SSA modernized and use new tools and methods to resolve biotic and abiotic stresses, b) improved soybean varieties with enhanced grain yield (genetic gain) developed and deployed, c) improved soy management practices developed and input bundling for different production systems generated, d) affordable small-scale farm mechanization, e) enhanced soy utilization for food and feed, f) economic impact of soybean known for selected FTF countries, and g) Soy public-private research for development (R4D) networks strengthened.

The objectives are: 1. Support targeted in-country and cross-border efforts by local partners (both local entities and locally established partners per current ADS 303 definitions) to expand the freedom of religion and conscience in Asia; 2. Promote the international religious freedom of China’s minority diaspora populations located in nearby or neighboring countries that have been subject to human rights violations (such as, but not limited to, Uyghur, Tibetan, and Christian communities); 3.

With FY 2021 funds, the mechanism will support anti-poaching patrols, agricultural productivity, entrepreneurship, strengthening of maternal and child health services as well as promote inclusive governance of communities. The maternal and child health component will focus on capacity building of community health workers to address household and community level factors that delay or prevent women from seeking ante-natal care or delivery at health facilities. The mechanism will also harness private investment and strengthen community governance institutions to include an enhanced understanding of the positive role that biodiversity conservation plays in improving socio-economic, health, food security and nutrition conditions. This will, in turn, inform and contribute to strengthening disincentives for illegal behavior, while increasing incentives for proper stewardship and pride in wildlife and tourism, thereby improving and stabilizing long-term economic and livelihood opportunities for rural communities.

This vast Miombo woodland landscape--measuring 42,000 km² or roughly the size of Switzerland--represents 36 percent of Mozambique’s conservation area (CA) network. The NSR is one of the largest and most important protected areas in Africa (Allan 2017). While Niassa is famous for its indigenous African elephant, lion and wild dog populations, its natural capital includes immense inselbergs, water resources, and forest carbon values. Large, well-managed protected areas such as the NSR are vital to restoring the viability of dwindling elephant and lion populations. Countering threats to the globally significant biological diversity of the NSR has been the focus of various U.S. Government (State Department, USAID, and US Fish and Wildlife Agency) programs of support since the 1990s. Beginning in 2015, USAID partnered with the Government of the Republic of Mozambique (GRM) National Administration for Conservation Areas (ANAC), the World Conservation Society (WCS), and two private NSR concessionaires (Luwire Wildlife Conservancy and Chuilexi Conservancy) to implement USAID’s Alliance for Ecosystem Conservation Systems, Markets, and Tourism (ECOSMART) activity. Through a Global Development Alliance (GDA) cooperative agreement with WCS, USAID has invested $14.8 million to conserve biodiversity and sustainably manage the natural resources of NSR, enhance the social and economic well-being of Niassa’s resident communities, and strengthen the national CA system. USAID/Mozambique is requesting a full application for a five-year, $10 million program to strengthen NSR-WCS co-management, NSR concessionaire coordination and compliance, law enforcement, and community conservation and community-based natural resources management (CBNRM) in the NSR and surrounding areas.

The commissioners and the CENI staff will encounter unprecedented challenges in the transition, including organizing elections in large swathes of the country that are insecure; carrying out new legislation to ensure the participation of internally displaced persons (IDPs), a population that has surged to 1.7 million in just five years; and an ambitious transition agenda and timeline, which in turn create challenges for citizen and civil society engagement. Additionally, there has been a drastic increase in disinformation circulating in the country, much of it originating from foreign influence campaigns aimed at influencing public opinion in the Sahel. Disinformation has been linked to massive protests and related violence. Broad civic participation by an informed populace will be critical for the credibility of the transition to civilian rule. Likewise, civil society and political parties will need to be active in consensus-building around constitutional and legal reform efforts. Additionally, an anticipated significant turnover of elected representatives will need support to demonstrate the benefits of democracy in the early stages of the new civilian government. Objective 1: Civil society supports increased citizen participation in reform, electoral, and governance processes. Objective 2: Electoral Management Bodies conduct technically sound and inclusive electoral processes. Objective 3: Post-transition governance is effective, participatory, and inclusive."	7e+06	"$3,880,026"	2023-08-09	2027-08-08	"USAID/Senegal"	"defunded"

"WORLD WILDLIFE FUND, INC."	"The purpose of this activity is to improve linear and other infrastructure safeguards necessary to prevent continued ecosystem degradation, especially biodiversity loss, that gravely threatens a healthy and climate-resilient future. USAID will build capacity and partnerships across sectors to implement environmental and social safeguards that help protect natural resources, address the climate crisis and bolster economic growth. The Indo-Pacific region is home to some of the world’s most abundant biodiversity and is rich in natural resources like energy, water, land, and clean air—all vital for countries’ long-term growth. Without strong safeguards, high demand leads to irresponsible development. USAID aims to strengthen safeguards in the region to protect Asia’s natural resources and biodiversity against over-exploitation, mitigate climate change by reducing forest loss by: (1) working towards adoption and enforcement of laws, policies, regulatory frameworks and standards; and (2) implementing conservation and sustainable practices, businesses, and trade and investment. These outcomes contribute to resilience to shocks including pandemics, climate change or other natural disasters and improved conservation of biodiversity. Effective safeguards protect people and the environment from harm; avoid or mitigate impacts on people and the environment; and are adaptive measures against climate change. The Asia Bureau will collaborate with related programs, including those of ADB, World Bank Group (WB), the private sector and others, to ensure long-term sustainability of development efforts. This initial tranche is envisioned to catalyze further investments from Missions."	6037311	"$5,445,145"	2021-09-30	2025-09-29	"USAID M/OAA"	"defunded"

"OPEN GOVERNMENT PARTNERSHIP SECRETARIAT"	"As noted in the 2021 U.S. Strategy on Countering Corruption, the United States remains committed to strengthening the international architecture in which multilateral initiatives, agreements, and standards magnify and give legitimacy to anti-corruption efforts around the world. The U.S. Strategy commits the United States to redoubling efforts in multilateral fora to push for anti-corruption measures, and to reinvigorating U.S. participation in the Open Government Partnership (OGP). USAID’s first-ever Anti-Corruption Policy, published in December 2022, committed the Agency to “continue championing the Open Government Partnership (OGP) as a vehicle for developing locally owned commitments, including by encouraging the accession of new countries to OGP and deepening OGP implementation in target countries”. This includes continuing to accelerate action on countering corruption using the OGP process, a priority that has grown only more important in the context of the Summit for Democracy (S4D), where a range of priority anti-corruption reforms were identified by the U.S. Government-led Summit for Democracy Financial Transparency and Integrity (FTI) Cohort as primed for uptake through OGP National Action Plans. In line with FTI priorities and the U.S. Strategy, this activity to expand and enhance OGP implementation at the country level , in particular to accelerate action against corruption. In summary, the program will support USAID’s efforts to address contemporary corruption threats to keep pace with the drivers, enablers, and manifestations of corruption today, especially transnational corruption; support countering corruption across sectors and from multiple angles, particularly during pivotal windows of opportunity for anti-corruption reform; and bolster USAID’s ability to forge new partnerships and coalitions to spur and sustain anti-corruption progress. Activities will complement and feed into global efforts led by the United States to advance the priorities of the FTI Cohort, including by advancing beneficial ownership transparency and accountable public procurement, and addressing corruption enablers in a critical mass of countries. This Activity will also ensure effective action and follow-up to broader country commitments made at the Summit for Democracy, including through linkages to the OGP platform, and will galvanize bold, multi stakeholder open government reform through the OGP platform"	2e+06	"$2,000,000"	2023-08-31	2026-08-30	"USAID M/OAA"	"defunded"

All implementing countries must adhere to the EITI Standard, which requires disclosure of mining exploration and production data; disclosure and reconciliation of all extractive revenues collected and paid; and oversight of EITI implementation by a formal multi-stakeholder group (MSG) involving the government, private sector, and civil society. At the country level, national EITI secretariats are tasked with implementation, reporting, and accountability to the MSG. At the international level, the EITI Secretariat (Secretariat) manages the overall EITI initiative, coordinating work with member countries, civil society, and supporting companies, and providing targeted technical assistance and support for peer learning. The Secretariat conducts all country validations, through which countries are assessed and held accountable for adherence to the EITI Standard, and plays a critical role in ensuring the success, transparency, and accountability of the overall initiative. In line with both the U.S. Strategy and the USAID Anti-Corruption Policy, the Countering Corruption in the Extractive Sector Activity will expand and enhance EITI implementation at the country level in order to counter corruption, including by supporting countries in meeting the requirements of the updated 2023 EITI Standard - which includes new efforts to address corruption risks in the energy transition - and by supporting greater uptake and progress on key priorities in the fight against transnational corruption, including enhancing systematic disclosures of data, increasing transparency of contracts, and supporting uptake of beneficial ownership transparency in the sector. Activities will complement and feed into global efforts led by the United States to advance the priorities of the U.S. government co-led Financial Transparency and Integrity (FTI) Summit for Democracy Cohort, including by advancing beneficial ownership transparency in a critical mass of countries through EITI's Opening Extractives program."	1750000	"$1,750,000"	2023-09-01	2026-08-31	"USAID M/OAA"	"defunded"

The primary goals of these projects are to mitigate the impacts of climate change, protect critical biodiversity, and enhance the livelihoods of local communities. Blue’s first project in Sierra Leone was recently published as a Pipeline Listing on Verra’s Verified Carbon Standards (VCS) Registry in August 2023 and can be found here. General background information and countries’ context: According to the USAID - Forest Carbon, Markets and Communities (FCMC) project, mangroves in West Africa represent 13% of mangrove forests worldwide and cover more than 2.4 million hectares across 19 countries. However, the region has experienced a rapid loss of its mangrove cover at a rate of 1.7% per year. At the same time, coastal communities in West Africa face high poverty levels, inequality, food insecurity, and vulnerability to the impacts of climate change such as sea level rise and coastal erosion. Women in particular face increased economic and social marginalization and climate vulnerability. Blue’s project areas are home to traditional fishing communities that have turned to mangrove cutting as a way to make income due to depleted fish stocks from foreign trawlers. Mangrove forests in Sierra Leone and Guinea are being deforested due to community members selling mangrove wood or using it for preserving fish through smoking, fuel for cooking, construction purposes, or other uses. Further, mangroves play an essential role as nursery areas for fish and shellfish, which contribute more than $400 million annually to the regional economy. Mangrove forests are also important for stabilizing the shoreline and buffering communities against the impacts of storms and sea level rise."	1500000	"$831,493"	2024-07-15	2026-07-14	"USAID/Guinea/Sierra Leone"	"defunded"

The current Activity will also be aligned to the USAID Climate Strategy 2022-2030 that recognizes that the negative effects of climate change disproportionately affect women, youth, Indigenous Peoples, persons with disabilities, and other marginalized and underrepresented groups. Restrictive gender and social norms limit access to opportunities, rights, and resources that contribute to resilience, including representation in climate decision-making bodies. Recognizing the contributions of these groups and empowering them to lead climate action is fundamental to combating climate change.

"The purpose of the Catalyzing Investment for Small Businesses (CISB) activity is to provide affordable access to finance and business advisory services to qualified small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and to attract impact investors to Sierra Leone. Once impact investors enter the Sierra Leone market the network will continue to grow. At the same time, as SMEs receive access to finance they will learn through the business advisory services and due diligence process how to be an investable business. In effect, CISB will not only mobilize investment in SMEs, but in addition, provide proof of concept (i.e. pilot) that Sierra Leone SMEs are profitable investments for impact investors. The long-term development goal post activity is to have this initial cycle of investment demonstrate to local banks that SMEs are investable at affordable rates thereby reducing the need for future impact investing and donor support. SME access to finance is a key development challenge that is highlighted in the U.S. Embassy’s Integrated Country Strategy (ICS), the government of Sierra Leone Medium Term National Development Plan (MTNDP), the Ministry of Agriculture National Agricultural Transformation Programme (NATP) and the Bank of Sierra Leone's National Strategy for Financial Inclusion (NSFI). The CISB activity partner, Pangea Global Ventures, is the private sector entity that will implement the project. The total project value is $3,000,000 with $2,500,000 coming from private sector partners (in the form of equity, loans, and in-kind contribution) and $500,000 from USAID.

"BENNIMIX FOOD COMPANY LTD"	"The BenniMix activity aims to address the interrelated problems of food insecurity, malnutrition, low agricultural productivity, and overreliance on imported foods in Sierra Leone. The program's underlying theory is that strengthening the capacity and productivity of smallholder farmers and the private sector partner will increase the supply of nutritious affordable foods to local markets. It is expected that providing 70 smallholder farmer groups with training, tools, credit, and technical assistance will enable them to adopt sustainable practices and increase yields of nutritious crops like sorghum, legumes, and orange-fleshed sweet potatoes. This will strengthen BFC's local supply chain, increasing annual raw material sourcing by 300MT (metric tons) by Year 3. With 43% more local sourcing, BFC can produce 600MT of nutritious blended foods annually, reducing costly imports by an estimated $3.6 - $4.8 million by year 3. Increased productivity and access to credit, assets, and markets is expected to raise smallholder farmer incomes by $20,000 - $30,000 per farmer group, per annum, improving their livelihoods hence access to essential products and services such as food, health, transportation, and education. Locally produced, nutritious foods will become more available helping reduce malnutrition, especially in children. 27,000 malnourished school children under five are expected to receive supplementary feeding per annum. Any potential excess product can be exported within the ECOWAS region, generating foreign exchange for the local economy. The program's market-based approach will empower BFC to coordinate implementation and provide training, processing, and market linkages. Success will be driven by effective collaboration between"	491000	"$491,000"	2024-05-06	2027-05-05	"USAID/Sierra Leone"	"defunded"

We have put in place a comprehensive proactive carpet cleaning plan to ensure the spaces are kept in the upmost conditions. While funding requests for carpet cleaning increased, the carpet's appearance and odor(s) have not improved with these standard periodic spot cleanings. There have been several walk-throughs conducted to identify and confirm that a more extensive cleaning program is necessary to help prevent mold and mildew growth, remove deep-seated pollutants, restore the appearance of carpets, and possibly extend the life of the carpet, therefore decreasing long-term expenses.

"LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY \"TRANSLATION BUREAU \"TRIS\""	"While USAID’s Regional Mission in Ukraine (USAID/Ukraine) relies on its own translation team to handle its routine translation and interpretation needs, the volume of these assignments varies greatly from day to day, and may not always be expeditiously addressed due to both time and capacity constraints. With these considerations in mind, USAID/Ukraine plans to continue using services of external vendors to tackle this “overflow” of translation and interpretation work at a level of quality that should meet the expectations of its internal customers. The two vendors that USAID/Ukraine has used for that purpose in the recent years have been: Mr. Dmytro Shkryoba, a freelance interpreter/translator; and TRIS translation agency. Having monitored their performance during that time (also using feedback from internal Mission customers), our conclusion is that both vendors have performed their assignments successfully. In the last two weeks, together with the Senior Procurement Agent here at the Mission, we have done market research using quotes from several local providers of translation/interpretation services to see if the rates that the current vendors are offering to continue their work for USAID/Ukraine are competitive on the local market. Based on the analysis, and on the knowledge of their past performance, it appears that the two current vendors are offering the best value for the money that the Mission is willing to expend on these services. Therefore, I would recommend that the contracts with both Mr. Shkryoba and TRIS be renewed or extended, as the case may be, using the rates they are offering for the new/extended contract period."	54713	"$48,192"	2019-09-30	2025-09-30	"USAID/Ukraine"	"defunded"
